This project automatically generates high-level information about
the OSMF servers. Previously this was maintained on the wiki, but this was
both time-consuming and error-prone.

This project takes the information that is gathered on each Chef run, and
parses it to gain the relevant information for the pages.

The code to generate these pages can be found at
[https://github.com/osmfoundation/osmf-server-info](https://github.com/osmfoundation/osmf-server-info)

Thank you to [https://github.com/gravitystorm](https://github.com/gravitystorm) for creating osmf-server-info.
